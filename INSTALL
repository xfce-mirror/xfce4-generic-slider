Prerequisites
=============

  Xfce-generic-slider-plugin requires the Xfce panel and probably nothing else.

Simple install procedure
========================

  To compile xfce-generic-slider-plugin, you should read over the Makefile to be sure it's correct for your system.
  Specifically change PREFIX if you want it installed in /usr/local instead of /usr. Then make sure the plugin binary
  and its desktop file are going to the right place. If you installed your other Xfce plugins with a package manager
  use the package manager to query the file lists for them to find out where plugins and plugin desktop files should
  go. If you compiled your other Xfce plugins from source, I certainly hope you already know. Once that's done, run
  make, then run make install as root.
